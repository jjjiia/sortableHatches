# sortableHatches
This is a small sketch that takes a google spreadsheet and visualizes it as sortable hatchmarks.

It uses colors for categorization, and messyness of hatchmarks as a linear scale. In this case, the data is my media consumption for the week and 
the messiness of the marks show productivity, the less productive, the messier the lines.

It relies heavily on Scott Wilson's post and js addon for importing google spreadsheets. This will allow google form inputs as well.

For info on using google spreadsheets with d3, see Wilson's post http://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/acit-rs-team/2014/10/08/how-to-get-data-out-of-a-google-spreadsheet-using-jsonp/
